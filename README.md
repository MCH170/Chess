Chess by MCH170

Made in quarantine because I was bored.


White pieces are represented by capital letters, black pieces by non-capital letters.

Each player types the coordinates of the piece he wants to move and the coordinates of the destination separated by space: eg. "e2 e4"

Checks are pointed out by the code but checkmates and stalemates are up to the players to figure out.

The move "en passant" is not implemented.
